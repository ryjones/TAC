# The Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance TAC

The Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is responsible for oversight of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance technical communities, including approving new proposals for project lifecycle changes, establishing community norms, workflows, or policies that are not within the scope of any single project, and resolving technical matters that affect multiple projects.
